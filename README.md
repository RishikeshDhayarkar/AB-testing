### Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener 

At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: "start free trial", and "access course materials". If the student clicks "start free trial", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks "access course materials", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.


In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked "start free trial", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. 

### Objectives of this experiment: 
• Lesser number dropouts from the free trail stage before the 14-day trial period.
• Improve overall student experience by providing a realistic view of course expectations 
• Improve the capacity of coaches to support students who are likely to finish the course

### Conclusion
This experiment was designed to determine if filtering students as a function of study time commitment would improve the overall student experience and the coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course, without significantly reducing the number of students who continue past the free trial. 

A statistically and practically significant decrease in Gross Conversion was observed from the results of both sign test and effect size calculation test. But there was no significant difference observed in Net Conversion for either of the tests. 

This shows that decrease in enrollment is not strongly associated to increase in the number of students staying for the requisite 14 days such that the at least one payment gets triggered. Based on this I would recommend not to launch the feature at this stage. More tests and data collection should be pursued.
